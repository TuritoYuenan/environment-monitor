# Swinburne Weather Service (codename: ZimmerWetter)

This is a university project aiming towards studying, researching and applying Internet-of-Things technology through developing and deploying a weather station system at the campus of Swinburne University of Technology in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam.

In short, an IoT Weather Station project.

## How to deploy? / Manual

### Raspberry Pi Component

1. Flash an operating system of your choice (or use your existing one)
2. Configure the Pi's network interface to use a **Static IP**
3. Install Docker and Docker Compose
4. Clone this repository
5. Copy the file `compose.override.template.yml` and name it `compose.override.yml`
6. Enter required information into the `compose.override.yml` file
7. Run `docker compose up -d` in your terminal (make sure the compose files are in the working directory)

### Weather Station Component

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the `esp32` directory using either **Arduino IDE** or **VSCode with Arduino extension**
3. Copy the file `secrets.template.h` and name it `secrets.h`
4. Enter required information into the `secrets.h` file
5. Connect an ESP32 to your device
6. Flash the Arduino sketch into the ESP32

## What does it measure?

- Temperature (ยบC)
- Humidity (%)
- Atmospheric pressure (Pa)
- Rainfall (mm)
- Wind speed (m/s)
- Wind direction (ยบ)
